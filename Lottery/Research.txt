Keep your losing tickets.

You can write off losing tickets against taxes paid on your winnings, if you win enough money in a year.

Plus, the author didn’t mention this, but for some lottery tickets, you can send in your losing ticket to be entered into a second chance lottery. The prizes aren’t as big but some people win anything from $1,000 and to even $1 million. And your chances of winning are even greater since most people don’t enter this second chance lottery.

Play responsibly!

2. Don’t buy quick picks.

Basically, if you buy only quick picks, it doesn’t increase your odds of winning. Your chances of winning are always the same. Instead, play the same numbers each time.
